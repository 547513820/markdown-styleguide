# Style Guidelines: Markdown
This document contains formatting standards for creating readable, consistent
files using Markdown.

One problem I run into constantly when creating Markdown
files is that I waste an ass-load of time fiddling with how the text looks
before it gets parsed. Then, after I'm finished writing, I waste even more time
adjusting what looks good in my text editor so that it looks good on in a
browser or Markdown viewer.

Being a sycophant, I of course decided to create a guideline I could follow
which would produce decent looking output without looking stupid in vim.
